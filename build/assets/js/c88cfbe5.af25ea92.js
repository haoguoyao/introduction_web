Temporal understanding must be inferred indirectly through state variables like cooldown timers or health deltas.\\n\\n---\\n\\n##  OpenAI Five: LSTM Over Time\\n\\nIn contrast, OpenAI Five **models a sequence of time steps**.\\n\\n### Input:\\nEvery agent (one per hero) observes the environment **every 4 frames**, resulting in **a long sequence of observations** \u2014 up to 20,000 steps in a full match.\\n\\n### Architecture:\\n- A **single-layer LSTM** with 1024 hidden units captures the agent\u2019s past observations and actions.\\n- This allows the agent to **remember previous events**, such as skill usage, movement patterns, or enemy behavior.\\n\\n>  OpenAI Five relies heavily on explicit memory. It passes and updates the `hidden_state` between steps, allowing the AI to form **temporal context** and learn long-horizon strategies.\\n\\n## Why the design differ between AlphaStar and OpenAI Five\\n\\nThe two games require different types of intelligence:\\n\\n- **StarCraft II** (AlphaStar):\\n  - Heavy emphasis on **multi-unit spatial micromanagement**.\\n  - Needs to understand \\"who is doing what\\" in the current frame.\\n  - Time can be indirectly inferred from unit states (e.g., cooldowns).\\n  - Transformer excels at modeling **relations between entities**.\\n\\n- **Dota 2** (OpenAI Five):\\n  - Involves **long-horizon team strategies** and skill combos.\\n  - Agents need memory of past actions, enemy sightings, map control.\\n  - LSTM is better suited for capturing **sequential decision patterns**."},{"id":"Mock Interview with customer","metadata":{"permalink":"/past_works/Mock Interview with customer","source":"@site/past_works/2023-12-01-project-1.md","title":"Mock Interview with customer","description":"A good resource for machine learning system design interview.","date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"project","permalink":"/past_works/tags/project"},{"inline":true,"label":"portfolio","permalink":"/past_works/tags/portfolio"}],"readingTime":0.21,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Guoyao Hao","title":"AI Engineer, Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/haoguoyao","page":{"permalink":"/past_works/authors/guoyao"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/haoguoyao"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/haoguoyao.png","key":"guoyao"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Mock Interview with customer","title":"Mock Interview with customer","authors":["guoyao"],"tags":["project","portfolio"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"How AI designed differently or Dota2 and StarCraft II","permalink":"/past_works/2024/07/28/starcraftdota"}},"content":"A good resource for machine learning system design interview.\\nhttps://bytebytego.com/courses/machine-learning-system-design-interview/visual-search-system\\nEach mock interview takes about 1.5 hour.\\n\\nIn additional to this, I also prepared system design for RAG system and anomoly detection.\\nWish the customer a good luck to his upcoming interview."}]}}')}}]);
